# Transparency Tool Prototype

## Source code notes
This is a modified version of a demo (http://jsfiddle.net/Tamersoul/dr7Dw/) for the library [Magic Wand JS](https://github.com/Tamersoul/magic-wand-js). The code for the demo is not structured particularly well, but the library itself works nicely and proves the concept.
